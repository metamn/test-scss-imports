  <p>User interface design has been around for decades. Lately a brand new profession — User Experience / UX design   emerged from it. Before that we had Human-Computer Interaction and usability design.</p>
<p>All these methodologies are focusing on a single issue: how to deliver a message to users via interactive visual interfaces. How to delight visitors yet deliver business goals.</p>
<p>We all agree every website / app sells something. A product, a service, a subscription, a photo. Information.</p>
<p>And design is the art and craft to make that sales happen.</p>
<h2 id="focus-points">Focus points</h2>
<p>Before UX there was Jakob Nielsen and usability. Since 1995 he taught us how to create effective websites, how to make people interact with your site in a way it will lead to certain, planned outcome.</p>
<p>While most of his advices are valid for websites <a href="http://www.nngroup.com/articles/113-design-guidelines-homepage-usability/">he made a statement</a> universally true for other interactive interfaces.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Visitors can focus only on five things on a single page.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol>
<li><strong>Identity</strong>  —  Making the visitor feeling safe, being in the right place</li>
<li><strong>Offer</strong>  —  What the page offers</li>
<li><strong>Values</strong>  —  What your site does that’s valuable from the user’s point of view, as well as how you differ from key competitors.</li>
<li><strong>Action</strong>  —  The highest priority tasks giving users a clear starting point for what to do next.</li>
<li><strong>Entertainment</strong>  —  If all above are not interesting for the user offer something fun which still connects / links back to your site.</li>
</ol>

<p>Sticking to these five focus points makes interface design simple and highly effective. They give us a foundation of how pages should be structured and each section visually weighted to reach a certain goal.</p>
<p>Focus points define how a product is laid out and how drives attention.</p>
<h2 id="focus-groups">Focus Groups</h2>
<p>With UX we’ve got richer — finally! — with user research. Despite being seemingly complicated by the hype around and by the new tools and job descriptions springing every day, User Experience is all about answering a question:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Who does what, how does it feels and flows?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you don’t have the resources — to run an entire UX department producing studies and prototypes — focus on just one thing: <em>how your product feels</em> to be able to define your message.</p>
<p>When creating my portfolio at <a href="http://metamn.io">http://metamn.io</a> I knew my target audience will be highly educated tech people with clear understanding of web design and development trends. And my message was:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hire me, I’m at the cutting edge of your industry.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To prove that I had to show something new, unique both in design and development.</p>
<p>For development I’ve created a living styleguide accompanying my portfolio and outsourced it. Even today I only knew companies not single individuals doing styleguide (Google’s Material Design, Lonely Planet’s Rizzo). That should deliver the message.</p>

<p>On design I went with something outside the box. I’ve picked an unusual layout, an electric and vibrant color palette, a modern typeface for text and a geeky one for the logo  —  thanks Jason Kottke! I’ve created a simple and minimal slider and accordion from scratch to communicate my visitors I’m out of the hype, I work with homegrown, unique ingredients and yet the result is enjoyable in all environments.</p>
<p>The portfolio should radiate now energy, strength in simplicity, courage in pushing the web forward yet sticking to it’s basic principles. This is how I think and feel, this is my message.</p>
