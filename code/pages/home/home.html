Web 3.0? Right, around ten years ago when Wordpress, Shopify, Etsy, Twitter, Tumblr and co was launched.</p><p>Now all you hear is social media, sharing economy, machine learning, blockchain and artificial intelligence, internet of things. None of them have anything to do with the web.</p><p>What happened? How the web got lost in the noise? I'm trying to understand this phenomena through analyzing it's underlying technology.</p><h2 id="from-presentation-to-interaction">From Presentation To Interaction</h2><p>Web 2.0 introduced us commenting and sharing — the first interactive artifacts since <em>add to cart</em> from the Amazon and E-bay era.</p><p>That was a revolution. Immediately brought us the REST and the MVC — technologies meant to replace plain simple presentation with heavy interactions on web pages. To move us from web sites to web apps.</p><p>It also brought us the cloud to move us from web servers to web services. And git to let code freely evolve.</p><p>Interactivity decomposed monoliths into quick moving atomic components. Today everything is possible on the web.</p><p>You can rent machine time to run your functions; spin up servers on demand when traffic goes high; use specific programming languages for specific tasks; decouple user interface from backend; compose applications on the fly; have same good looking apps like internet giants; many more and all for <em>free</em>.</p><p>Such a perfect time to do web! It's never been easier and more enjoyable to create!</p><h2 id="from-people-to-machine">From People To Machine</h2><p>How this fine progress can't be enough for the web to hit the headlines again?</p><p>Yeah, when <em>free</em> then you are the product.</p><p>It seems, by its nature, the web become a vehicle to a higher order entity. Together with it's successor the app, matched with the advertising<sup id="footnote--1"><a href="#footnotes--1">1</a></sup> driven business model, we see now a shift from human to machine.</p><p>It's not what somebody can do with technology but what machine can do with the outcome of all these.</p><p>Everything we create and do — from user interfaces to phone calls — goes <em>semantic</em>: understandable by algorithms. Everything we optimize — infrastructures, processes, tools, ourselves — shifts control to machine.</p><p>Now all what's left to us is to <a href="https://imgur.com/gallery/RYP2L">blame the algorithm</a>.</p></div><nav class="article__footnotes"><h3>Footnotes</h3><ol class="ol"><li class="li" id="footnotes--1"><span class="footnote"><span class="footnote__link"><a class="link" href="http://metamn.io/gust/advertising" title="Advertising">Advertising</a></span> <span class="footnote__go-back"><a class="link" title="Back to the footnote" href="#footnote--1"><span class="arrow-with-triangle arrow-with-triangle--top"><span class="arrow-with-triangle__line"></span> <span class="triangle triangle--top arrow-with-triangle__triangle"></span></span> <span class="text">Back to the footnote</span></a></span></span></li></ol></nav><aside class="article__categories-and-date"><h3>Article categories and date</h3><nav class="article__categories"><h3 class="title">Categories</h3><span class="categories">trend, code</span></nav><time class="article__date">Nov 21, 17</time></aside></article>

<article class="article"><h3 class="article__title"><a class="link" href="http://metamn.io/beat/democratization-of-design" title="Democratization of design">Democratization of design</a></h3><div class="article__content"><p>WordPress, a company started at the same time like Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr, Shopify — and which powers 30% of all websites today — is rolling out a new version of it's web app this month with a game changing feature called Gutenberg.</p><p>Gutenberg<sup id="footnote--1"><a href="#footnotes--1">1</a></sup> is a new web editor enabling people to design their own website visually.</p><p>This is not the first attempt to let people freely design their own websites. Atavist, Wix, ReadyMag, Jux have all tried before but, as it always happens, after ahead of time innovation and failure there is a momentum when and attempt becomes truly successful.</p><p>That momentum is now. Delivered by WordPress via it's huge reach and ecosystem together with React a revolutionary tool created by Facebook.</p><p>These two put together can't miss to make everyone a designer.</p><p>Log in to WordPress, throw together some React components called Gutenberg blocks, and voila, in a few hours your website is ready.</p><h2 id="seismic">Seismic</h2><p>When everybody is a designer seismic shift happens in the background. A few classic software jobs — UI/UX designer, front-end and back-end developer — will sink together with entire industries.</p><p>There won't be any, or much less need for these roles and their tools. People will use a new design tool — the browser! — and they'll use it in real time.</p><p>They won't fire up Photoshop or Sketch to design and wait for god / miracle / yet another developer to implement their creation.</p><p>They won't fire up the browser and go to the back-end, to a dashboard, to a content management system or e-commerce engine as we know today. They will make changes on the front-end in a <em>what you see is what you get</em> fashion in real time.</p><p>Instead of monolithic, incompatible, incumbent systems, servers and apps — atomic, highly interactive and interoperable components will be everywhere running on micro service architecture.</p><p>Components. A mix of UI/UX design, front-end code with back-end support, packaged in a self-sustaining fashion. You just drop content on them and pick up a style to display. Nothing more.</p><h2 id="painful">Painful</h2><p>The democratisation of design starts with WordPress and it will painful for the half of the industry in a similar way like Artificial Intelligence is painful by taking away jobs.</p><p>Instead of millions of themes, hundreds of visual theme builders, dozens of content management and e-commerce systems there will be a few component frameworks, compatible with each other, using universal design systems like Google's Material Design or another system coming from another major player.</p><p>Personally I'm happy with this. Our industry is overpopulated, deeply perverted, with lots of charlatans and overnight pixel pushers reinventing the same wheel every day hidden behind soundy job titles for large sums of money driving the global gentrification. It's time to cool down and make a reality check.</p><h2 id="the-scenario">The scenario</h2><p>What really concerns me is how the large public with no design education and aesthetic sense will manage to come up with a good looking, finished website?</p><p>And how we can avoid all those websites looking the same?</p><p>Masses fed up with social networks will start soon leaving the silos and looking for something original to express themselves even on the cost of the likes.</p><p>They'll flock into WordPress; choose a design system; pick up some components and color schemes; in an afternoon they'll come up with the solution, in ecstasy. The next day they'll wake up and realize a.) they won't win the next Awwwards and b.) their creation looks like almost as the guys' next door.</p><p>What we can do in the next short years to satisfy them all? We don't want every new site look alike neither to be ugly. We don't want to make people disappointed by the web immediately after a disappointment in social networks.</p><h2 id="intelligent-components">Intelligent components</h2><p>I guess the race is to create intelligent components which can't be abused by layman to break the associated design system.</p><p>Or: to create a highly customizable design system built on intelligent components which preserves their unity even under heavy misuse.</p><p>We don't want another Theme Forrest or Geocities.</p><p>Years ago I wrote a similar tech-fiction article called <em>Devices as Designers</em><sup id="footnote--2"><a href="#footnotes--2">2</a></sup> where I was musing about highly intelligent components assembled into a system by AI and displayed from watches, websites to interactive installations on skyscrapers.</p><p>We are not too far from that and neither closer. But still to follow that path. Instead of devices people will do the task of assembling interfaces in a less intelligent way forcing us to come up with more intelligent components and design systems.</p><p>Our new tools first of all has to teach people how to design. To realize what they really want is not to throw another slider and two gradients with a killer hero on a canvas, but to deliver a message.</p><p>We should come up with design wizards framing the everyday designers' urge and push into creating usable content first then let the rampage happen, in a coordinated way, when these newly found design flamethrowers — we call components — are put in practice.</p><p>The winners in this race will be companies who educate their users, force them to stick to best practices, and after the basics are set up unleash their users with novel, AI based components instead of drowning them with sliders, heroes and hamburger menus again.</p><p>Yes, we will have to equip our components with semantics, making them understandable by both their users who will act as designers, and by the underlying tech stack powered by AI bringing in the entertainment and perhaps the new enlightenment.</p></div><nav class="article__footnotes"><h3>Footnotes</h3><ol class="ol"><li class="li" id="footnotes--1"><span class="footnote"><span class="footnote__link"><a class="link" href="https://wordpress.org/gutenberg/" title="WordPress Gutenberg">WordPress Gutenberg</a></span> <span class="footnote__go-back"><a class="link" title="Back to the footnote" href="#footnote--1"><span class="arrow-with-triangle arrow-with-triangle--top"><span class="arrow-with-triangle__line"></span> <span class="triangle triangle--top arrow-with-triangle__triangle"></span></span> <span class="text">Back to the footnote</span></a></span></span></li><li class="li" id="footnotes--2"><span class="footnote"><span class="footnote__link"><a class="link" href="http://metamn.io/beat/tomorrowww/" title="Devices as designers">Devices as designers</a></span> <span class="footnote__go-back"><a class="link" title="Back to the footnote" href="#footnote--2"><span class="arrow-with-triangle arrow-with-triangle--top"><span class="arrow-with-triangle__line"></span> <span class="triangle triangle--top arrow-with-triangle__triangle"></span></span> <span class="text">Back to the footnote</span></a></span></span></li></ol></nav><aside class="article__categories-and-date"><h3>Article categories and date</h3><nav class="article__categories"><h3 class="title">Categories</h3><span class="categories">design, trend</span></nav><time class="article__date">Nov 11, 18</time></aside></article>

This article is a case study not an opinionated piece.</p><p>To make it purely objective the first introductory part — Comps — and the last sections — Pain; Cure — were rewritten. The rest, the case study was untouched.</p><p><strong>&lt;/update&gt;</strong></p><p><strong>&lt;disclaimer&gt;</strong></p><p>I'm in equal measure a designer — self-taught with works featured in online galleries and theme stores — and developer — with a degree in Computer Science.</p><p>This is a privileged situation some people find it funny, others unbelievable, others take it with envy.</p><p>I use it to create with confidence, end-to-end, from user research to performance. And to share the findings with others as often as possible.</p><p><strong>&lt;/disclaimer&gt;</strong></p><h2 id="comps">Comps</h2><p>Occasionally I do freelancing for clients and often times I'm hired at the development phase.</p><p>This means I'm receiving comps from designers either coming from Photoshop or Sketch, wrapped or not into Zeplin.</p><p>These comps are imperfect. They contain design decisions not grounded in web development best practices. Making a comp work sometimes is very painful and expensive.</p><p>I've been long waiting for a case study which speaks for itself. Let's see it.</p><h2 id="the-task">The task</h2><p>It sounds simple: list the latest posts on the homepage in a responsive way.

CSS Grid has no support for grid gap styling <sup id="footnote--2"><a href="#footnotes--2">2</a></sup> and a nasty hack <sup id="footnote--3"><a href="#footnotes--3">3</a></sup> has to be used to accomplish this original design idea.</p><blockquote><p>The designer doesn't knows exceptions are painful and bloat the source code</p></blockquote><p>... and inserts an ad between the rows. The ad has different dimension and positioning which breaks the grid. An exception has to be added to support this design decision bloating the code during development time and later during maintenance.</p><h2 id="solutions">Solutions</h2><p>If the designer were coding or consulting with a developer the following design decisions were taken:</p><ol><li><p>Do not hide posts on smaller screens — wrap them into a navigation element. This way the resources used to get all posts on the back-end would have been not wasted on the front-end.</p></li><li><p>Forget the vertical column separator lines. They can't be implemented with current best practices and they need workaround. Let form follow function even if function is coding standards.</p></li><li><p>Put that ad elsewhere. Combined with 2.) it's dangerous. Moving out of the grid will spare around half of development time and budget.</p></li></ol><p>With these practical design decisions the implementation would have been easy: use the CSS Grid. Time spent would be from minutes to around half an hour.</p><p>With vertical borders the CSS Grid technique — used across the site up until now — cannot be re-used. A research has to be done to see if the specification added the grid gap styling feature recently, or if there is a polyfill, or a nice workaround.</p><p>It turned out only a workaround exists which won't fully solve the problem since the suggested bordering is ... complicated: it applies to middle columns treating columns at the edge as exceptions.</p><p>Time spent with research and workarounds: around an hour.</p><p>To implement the comp a loop has to be created over grid elements adding border only where necessary. For that I've already had a component built on Flexbox. Importing, adjusting to this current project took around half an hour. If it had to be written from scratch it would take at least an hour in plus.</p><p>Inserting the ad between the posts is way more complicated. It's about adding exceptions to an existing well working code. The back-end code displaying a post list has to be modified to insert the ad; on the front-end the grid has to be re-drawn and re-bordered.</p><p>The final front-end code is so ugly it is worth a look. <sup id="footnote--1"><a href="#footnotes--1">1</a></sup></p><p>Time spent: around an hour.</p><h2 id="numbers">Numbers</h2><table><caption><span class="text">The cost of the solutions</span></caption><thead><tr><th>Solution</th><th>Duration (min)</th><th>Notes</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Practical implementation</td><td>30</td><td>Using the CSS Grid</td></tr><tr><td>Vertical borders — research</td><td>60</td><td>Wasted.
